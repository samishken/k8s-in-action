# Notes

### Service Accounts
- Assign pods with Service Accounts
- Service Accounts vs User Accounts
- `Users Accounts`: for humans. A User account will have a kube config file. And using kubectl they connect to that Kubernetes cluster.
- `Service Accounts`: for services.  Ex.  pod wants to access k8s API server.
